# foundation-of-science-game
A little programming game that helps to familiarize with the scientific method and its boundarys


# Level ideas:
- funky geometrys
- simple model for complex world (ockham)
- random numbers appear to build coherrent picture
- obsever dependence (needs things that can be observed)

not clear how to implement yet:
- measurement errors?

# How to get started
Right now there is not yet a whole game just single levels.
Either run `terminal_interface.py` to have a nice interface surrounding the level or create an instance of `Euclidean` in a shell and explore it directly (of course without peeking at the definition or guessing something from the name)
